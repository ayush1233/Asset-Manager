You are a senior full-stack engineer.

Build a production-ready VC Intelligence platform called “ScoutFlow” inspired by Harmonic-style workflows and thesis-driven scouting systems.

This must be a real Next.js 14 App Router project, fully deployable to Vercel.

The application must strictly follow these requirements.

🏗 TECH STACK

LocalStorage for persistence

Server-side API route for enrichment

Environment variables for API keys

Architecture must look clean and professional.

🎯 PRODUCT GOAL

Discover → Open Profile → Enrich → Score → Save → Add Notes → Add to List → Export

The product must feel premium, modern, and VC-grade.
